        <p>

        <h3 id="objective">
            What is the Objective of the game

        <p>
            The objective is to win the game. To win, your team needs more points than the opponents team.

        </h4>
        <p>
            There is a three point line. Inside the three point line if you shoot (unless it's a free-throw, explained
            later), it is worth two points. If you shoot outside the line, it is worth three points. You shoot
            free-throws
            if there is a foul (more on that explained later). If you make a bucket from either the three point line or
            inside the three point line, you will get points, 3 and 2 respectively.

        <h4 id="howlong2score">
            How long do you have to score the points?

        <p>
            Regulation time is 48 minutes, split into four quarters, with each quarter being 12 minutes. If the score is
            tied after regulation, there will be an overtime (ot) for 5 minutes. If the game is still tied, then there
            will
            be ot-2, and that keeps going until a team wins after the 5 minutes in ot.

        <h4 id="typesoffouls">
            Types of fouls
        </h4>
        <h5 id="regular">
            Regular Foul
        </h5>
        <p>
            A regular foul is some small contact. If that team has 5 Team Fouls (A Team Foul is the amount of fouls a
            team
            has in a quarter) or more, the person who was fouled will get two free-throws. If a player has 6 fouls, it
            is
            out for the rest of the game.
        </p>
        <h5 id="shooting">
            Shooting Foul
        </h5>
        <p>
            Shooting Fouls are similar to Regular Fouls, except it's in a shooting motion. If you do a shooting foul,
            the
            opponent gets the amount of free-throws as points he/she would've made if the shot would've made. If the
            shot
            made, and you did a shooting foul, then your opponent gets the points for the buckets and one free-throw.
        </p>
        <h5 id="technical">
            Technical Fouls
        </h5>
        <p>
            You can get a Technical Foul when you scream at the referee/official. If you do a Technical Foul, the
            opposing
            team gets to shoot one free-throw. Anyone on the team currently on the field can shoot those free-throws. A
            team's coach can also be called for a Technical Foul if he/she screams at the referee/official. If you get
            two
            Technical Fouls in a game, you're ejected (Even coaches can get ejected). In the NBA, for each 16 technical
            fouls you do per season, you are not allowed to play for one game.
        </p>
        <h5 id="flagrant">
            Flagrant Fouls
        </h5>
        <p>
            There are two different types of Flagrant Fouls: Flagrant I and Flagrant II:

        <h6 id="flag1">
            Flagrant I
        </h6>
        <p>
            Flagrant Foul I's are when a player does unnecessary contact. If you get two Flagrant I's, you're ejected.
        </p>
        <h6 id="flag2">
            Flagrant II
        </h6>
        <p>
            Flagrant Foul II's are when a player does unnecessary and excessive contact. If you do a Flagrant I, you're

            The <a href="http://www.nba.com" id="nbalink">NBA</a> (National Basketball Association) is made up of 30
            teams, 15 in
            each
            conference. Each season has 82 games. In both confernces, the top 6 will make the playoffs. The 7th-10th
            seeds
            will play in the play-in tournament. I will tell you more information on the play-in tournament below. Then
            there is the playoffs. I will also explain to you about those later.

            The NBA Play-in Tournaments are best of one series. The 6th to 10th seeds of both confernces play to find
            the
            7th and 8th seed for the playoffs. 7th plays 8th in the 7th Seed Game, 9th plays 10th in the Eliminator, and
            the
            Loser of the 7th Seed Game plays the winner of the Eliminator for the 8th seed game. The winner of the 7th
            seed
            game and the 8th seed game get the 7th and 8th seed, respectively. After that, the playoffs start.

            quarter, but lost it. Klay Thompson found it in the fourth quarter and the Warriors won it by 10. The Series

            Game 5 - NBA Finals
        </h3>
        <p>
            Game 5 was on Monday, June 13th. The Warriors defense was really good to start the game off. They were
            leading by double-digits for most of the first quarter, and wouldn't have allowed 10 if it weren't for
            Jayson Tatum for getting hot after taking a quick rest. In the second quarter, the Warriors kept their
            momentum alive. Steph wasn't doing too well, as he couldn't make threes, but he was going in the paint.
            Draymond Green and Gary Payton II were doing really good. But they weren't doing the best. Andrew Wiggins
            was doing the best for them. The Warriors defense was so good in the first half that they didn't allow
            Boston to make a three-pointer until late in the half, where they made three straight to end it. In the
            third quarter, the Celtics started off super strong, and made their three straight threes into nine straight
            threes. They had started off 0/12 from deep, and ever since then, they were 9/9! They got their first lead
            of the game there, but unfourtunetly for them, they couldn't hold onto it for much longer. The Warriors made
            sure their lead wasn't higher than 5 points, which they did well. They did not allow their lead to go
            higher, and even made the game go back and fourth in the end of the third. Jordan Poole made yet another
            deep buzzer beater three-pointer, which gave the Warriors momentum entering the final quarter. They were up
            by 1 point as they were in Game 4. The Warriors started off with the momentum and took the game back to 10
            points. Then Boston couldn't grab it back and ended up losing by 10. Andrew Wiggins got 26 points along with
            13 rebounds, for his second consecutive double-double. For the Celtics, Tatum had 27 points and 10 rebounds,
            which wasn't enough for them. Jordan Poole got 14 points in 14 minutes. Stephen Curry got 16 points and 8
            assists, even though he didn't make a single three. That was the first playoff game for Steph where he
            didn't make a three. Even Wiggin's didn't. But it was enough for the Warriors to take the win and be up 3-2.
            They have a chance to close it out in Boston in Game 6. Boston will need to win both Game 6 and Game 7 to
            win the championship, though they did that against the Bucks in the Conference Semi-Finals. This series is
            not over, and we'll see if it will be or not in Game 6, which is on Thursday, June 16th at 9:00 PM ET (6:00
            PM PT)

            Game 6 - NBA Finals
        </h3>
        <p>
            Game 6 was on Thursday, June 16th. It was a win or go home game for Boston, as they needed to win to keep
            their season alive. For the Warriors, they wanted to end it here in Boston so there wouldn't have to be a
            Game 7 later. But they could afford losing, while Boston could not. This put a bunch of pressure on the
            Boston team. With the crowd cheering them, they got an amazing start, 12-2. Then the Warriors came back on a
            run and made it 16-22 Boston. Then, the Warriors went on a <i>21-0</i> run, the longest in the last 50 years
            in the NBA Finals. It started off with a Gary Payton II missed three, which got him the rebound. He then
            scored two points by a layup. Then a Draymond Green three-pointer. Then a Steph Curry three-pointer. Then a
            Jordan Poole three-pointer. Then another three from Jordan Poole following a missed shot from Wiggins and an
            offensive rebound from Draymond. Then a hard layup from Andrew Wiggins. Then a missed three from Poole, but
            offensive rebound from Draymond Green who got it back to Poole for a three, which made. Then a Andrew
            Wiggins Slam Dunk. Boston had to call two time-outs, which led them to only have 4 remaining with a little
            bit more than 10 minutes in the first half. The Boston were down by 15 points at half-time, and by then the
            Warriors just needed to maintain their lead. The Celtics took the third-quarter once again, and lowered the
            Warriors lead to 10 entering the final 12 minutes of the game, and possibly of the season. The Celtics now
            had a chance at forcing Game 7, but they needed to play great on both sides of the court. They started off
            good, cutting the Warriors lead short. But then they lost it and their chances were slim once again. The
            Warriors did what they needed to and ended up winning the fourth by three points. The Warriors had won the
            2022 NBA Championship, and they now had gotten the title 4 times in the last eight years. Jayson Tatum & the
            Celtics had lost, after making it a fun and interesting series. Stephen Curry for Finals MVP, averaging 31.2
            Points per Game, 6 Rebounds per Game, and 5 Assists per Game. Poole, Klay, and Wiggins all averaged 10+
            Points per Game. But it was Steph, Wiggins, and Draymond Green who carried them the most. Wiggins and Green
            both were averaging more than 8 rebounds per game. Green was the only Warrior averaging more than 6 assists
            per game. The Warriors are the 2022 NBA Champions.

            <b>L</b>e<b>B</b>ron <b>J</b>ames
        </h3>
        <p>
            Le<b>B</b>ron <b>J</b>ames is said to be the best player currently in the NBA. He started playing without
            going t
            college, and came into the 2003 NBA Draft. He was drafted as the first overall pick by the Cleveland
            Cavaliers, and stayed there for 6 seasons. Then he moved to the Heat in 2010 and won a couple of
            championships there. After winning he came back to the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he won a Championship in
            2016. They went to the finals four years in a row, from 2015 all the way until 2018, and all of them were
            against the Golden State Warriors. The Cleveland Cavaliers were 1-3. In 2018, <b>L</b>e<b>B</b>ron moved to
            the LA Lakers
            to hopefully win a championship there, which he did. In 2020, him, along with Anthony Davis, won a
            championship inside the bubble (due to COVID-19). After that, though, <b>L</b>eBron hasn't been performing
            as well
            and maybe is losing his position as the best player currently in the NBA. Coming into the 2022 season, the
            Lakers had many NBA Greats, including Russel Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Anthony Davis, and more, but
            couldn't even make the playoffs.

            <b>S</b>tephen <b>C</b>urry
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>S</b>tephen <b>C</b>urry is one of the best NBA Players in NBA history, and the best shooter in NBA
            history. He was
            drafted in 2009 by the Golden State Warriors as the 7th pick, which was considered lucky for Warriors at the
            time and now as Chris Mullin, one of the greatest players the Warriors had drafted before, was a 7th pick.
            As a rookie, <b>S</b>tephen <b>C</b>urry did awesome, and did as good in the next few years. His buddies,
            Klay
            Thompson and
            Draymond Green were drafted 2 and 3 years later respectively. In 2013, they made the Playoffs and started
            their dynasty. In the 5 years, from 2015-2019, they made the NBA Championship all 5 times, and won 3 of
            them. Even though <b>S</b>tephen <b>C</b>urry never got Finals MVP, he was the main reason the Warriors won
            according to many many
            people. Why? His shooting. <b>S</b>tephen <b>C</b>urry's shooting was one of the best you could see. He
            introduced the Half-court
            shot to the NBA, and has made many deeper shots. In 2015 and 2016 he got MVP. In 2020, when the Warriors
            were the worst team in the league, he was injured most of the time. In 2021, he single-handedly led the
            Warriors to the 8th seed, but they lost in the Play-in round to the Grizzlies and didn't make the playoffs.
            In 2022 though, <b>S</b>tephen <b>C</b>urry carried his team, along with Klay Thompson and Andrew Wiggins,
            and they won the 2022 NBA Championship. He also for his first ever Finals MVP in 2022, adding to what people
            called, "the missing piece" of <b>S</b>teph's Trophy Cabinet.

            <b>K</b>evin <b>D</b>urant
        </h3>
        <p>
            Drafted as the second pick for the Supersonics in the 2007 NBA draft, <b>K</b>evin <b>D</b>urant was a star.
            He got Rookie of the Year, and in 2010 became an all star. The Supersonics became the Thunder, and Durant,
            along with Rusell Westbrook & James Harden led them to a NBA Final appearance, but lost there. In the 2016
            offseason, after the Warriors went 73-9 and lost in the Finals, Durant came to the Warriors to join Klay
            Thompson, <a class="colordiffer" href="#stephcurry">Stephen Curry</a>, and Draymond Green. KD won finals MVP
            in 2017 & 2018 as he carried the Warriors. In 2019, he suffered a big injury in Game 5 of the NBA Finals,
            when the Warriors
            were down 3-1. That was the game he came back from a smaller injury, and after scoring a little bit, he
            suffered another one. He was out for a year after that, and the Warriors ended up losing 4-2. After that, he
            moved to the Nets with DeAndre Jordan & Kyrie Irving. In the 2020-2021 season, James Harden joined the Nets.
            They still lost to the Milwaukee Bucks 4-3 in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals. In 2022, Durant
            was injured in the middle of the season as well. But as Harden was traded to the 76ers, it was only him &
            Irving. They didn't do that well, and ended up getting swept by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the
            2022 NBA Playoffs.
